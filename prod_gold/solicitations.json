SCOPE OF WORK/SPECIFICATIONS    The South Carolina Dept of Social Services is tasked with promoting the safety permanency and well-being of  children and vulnerable adults and helping individuals achieve stability and strengthening families. To assist  with its mission the agency is seeking a SaaS solution to increase recruitment of  foster families to provide  suitable care for youth while decreasing the time it takes to approve licensure of families and ensure that families  including kin are able to complete the process and provide a safe home for children and youth in foster care.  DSS believes that the licensing and placement will benefit from enhanced collaboration between public and  private agencies and envisions a solution that will also make this possible. The expected outcomes of using a  SaaS solution are an increase in the number of foster homes approved per year in addition to reducing the time  and complexity of completing the process for potential foster families.     Users for this platform will both be internal DSS employees and external users such as Child Placing Agencies  and their staff foster parents prospective foster parents kinship parents and prospective kinship foster parents  and all group care providers and their staff. While it is not possible to accurately estimate the total number of  users DSS expects a minimum of 8000 individual users including group care providers.  This number is  subject to change during the life of the contract.          The contractor\u2019s solution must encompass both licensing (new licenses and renewals) and placement. The  solution must support Foster Parent Kinship Foster Parent Group Home Licensing and meet the following  requirements:    Licensing Process \u2013 Families   The licensing module must provide a portal that allows potential and current foster families to:            Page 19      Licensing Process \u2013 DSS Staff   The licensing module must provide a portal that allows DS Staff to:                 Licensing - Group Homes       Child Placement Requirements   The child placement module will be used by state agency employees child placing agencies and group  home provider staff and it must allow the placement staff to:                            Page 20      Specific functions of the software must include:                             Page 21    Contractor must have online pre-recorded training that is available to DSS\u2019s staff and foster families on demand.  Preferred for training for state agency licensing and placement entity staff is a mixture of recorded training and  availability to walk through the solution and answer questions. Any assistance for prospective foster parents  utilizing the portal should be integrated into or available through the platform.       Integration  The application shall integrate with the Case Management System of record the Child and Adult  Information System (CAPSS) to allow a bi-directional interface of Contractor\u2019s Licensing and Placement  modules to existing licensing and placement modules in CAPSS. The CAPSS Application is an intranet  Windows application with a MS-SQL server Database backend. Solution interfacing with CAPSS is up 24/7  as DSS build redundancy around it (e.g. Primary and Secondary servers with real time replication.) SCDSS  will provide more technical details and DB schemas roles and functions to the Contractor.        Security  The application shall meet the following requirements:            The web portal shall meet the following requirements:       Page 22            Vulnerability and Intrusion Testing:     No unauthorized ports are open   Latest device patches/updates have been applied to server   Vulnerabilities within utilized version of software   Reporting on all areas where known vulnerabilities exist.

Contractor will schedule maintenance between the hours of 10 PM and 4:00 AM Eastern Time. Contractor  will provide Licensee with reasonable advance written notice of scheduled downtime. Contractor may  access the Platform during the scheduled maintenance downtimes for maintenance purposes and to  implement Updates bug fixes and/or any other changes that the Contractor deems necessary or advisable.

Your proposal may be evaluated and your offer  accepted without any discussions negotiations or prior notice. Ordinarily nonresponsive proposals will be rejected outright  without prior notice. Nevertheless the State may elect to conduct discussions including the possibility of limited proposal  revisions but only for those proposals reasonably susceptible of being selected for award. [11-35-1530(6); R.19- 445.2095(I)] If improper revisions are submitted during discussions the State may elect to consider only your unrevised  initial proposal provided your initial offer is responsive. The State may also elect to conduct negotiations beginning with  the highest ranked offeror or seek best and final offers as provided in Section 11-35-1530(8).

[06-6058-1]     EVALUATION FACTORS -- PROPOSALS (JAN 2006)     Offers will be evaluated using only the factors stated below. Evaluation factors are stated in the relative order of importance  with the first factor being the most important. Once evaluation is complete all responsive offerors will be ranked from most  advantageous to least advantageous. [06-6065-1]    Responsive and responsible offerors with the mathematical possibility of being the highest ranked Offeror after  the Part I evaluation will advance to Part II Live Demonstration. SCDSS will select and may enter into  negotiations with the offeror with the highest combined Part I and Part II score provided that Offeror meets all  other criteria of the solicitation. Total Possible Points from Part 1 and Part 2 is 125  Example (for illustrative purposes only.)  The state receives three responsive offers and the evaluation scores them. When the evaluation panel\u2019s scores  are summed and divided by the number of evaluators the offerors have the following quotient scores for Phase  I.          Page 31  Offeror  Average Score After Phase I  Offeror A  80  Offeror B  85  Offeror C  54    The maximum points available for Phase II is 25 so even if Offeror A and B both scored 0 for this phase and  Offeror C scored 25 Offeror C\u2019s ranking would not change. The points spread in the example means that Offeror  C has no mathematical possibility of being the highest ranked Offeror and the state would not invite Offeror C  to participate in Phase II.  SCDSS will give Offerors who qualify for Phase II further instructions regarding the oral presentation. Oral  Presentations will be held virtually with each presentation scheduled for two hours. Offerors\u2019 proposed Key  Personnel as described in this document must participate in the oral presentation.

The procurement manager will not  release offers to the panel until they have all signed the aforementioned documentations.   Page 32  (c) The evaluation panel will meet a second time to discuss and score Offeror\u2019s technical proposals. The  procurement manager will not reveal any pricing information at this time but will use the information to  calculate offerors who qualify to participate in Phase II of the evaluation process. The procurement  officer will not return these score sheets to the panel until after they have evaluated and scored the  demonstrations. At this point in the process the procurement manager alone will have access to\u2014and  knowledge of\u2014the price proposals.   (d) The evaluation panel will attend the presentations and each member will assign an independently  determined score to each. At this point the procurement manager will return the evaluators\u2019 score sheets  from Phase I to them and ask them to sum their points plus the points for price assigned by the  procurement manager. The evaluators will be asked to sum their scores form Phase I and Phase II leave  executive session and sign their score sheets.  (e) The procurement manager will use these scores to determine the highest ranked offeror.

As used in this clause these terms are defined as follows:  \u201cCommercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Software\u201d means software used with no customization and for which source code is not  made available to licensees.  \u201cConfiguration\u201d means any customer-specific modification to software that does not require changes to the software\u2019s source  code such as rules-based rules engine based or parameter driven modifications to configure the software.  \u201cCustomization\u201d means any customer-specific modification to software that requires changes to the software\u2019s source code.  \u201cFirmware\u201d means software sold or licensed only in conjunction with machines designed for execution only on a machine  with which it is provided designed only for machines other than a dedicated computer and embedded into or installed on the  machine by the machine\u2019s manufacturer or seller.  \u201cLicensor\u201d means an entity that owns the intellectual property rights for an item of software or has the authority to license or  sublicense the software directly to the using governmental unit.  \u201cPiggyback\u201d means the document attached to this solicitation and entitled South Carolina Standard Amendment To End User  License Agreements For Commercial Off-The-Shelf Software \u2013 Single Agency  which serves as South Carolina\u2019s standard  amendment to a licensor\u2019s standard software licensing agreement (regardless of how denominated e.g. master software  licensing agreement end user license agreement) for COTS. [Note: While the piggyback is generally indicative of what the  State finds acceptable terms in a Licensor\u2019s standard software licensing agreement may need to be negotiated.]  \u201cSoftware\u201d means a combination of computer instructions and data definitions that enable computer hardware to perform  computational or control functions excluding firmware.  \u201cSoftware licensing agreement\u201d means any agreement regardless of how designated that defines the intellectual property  rights for or the rights to use any software product. A software licensing agreement must address only terms directly  associated with licensing the right to use the software and must not address any of the work governed by the contract or any  services (other than warranty services regarding the software code or associated documentation).  \u201cSoftware maintenance\u201d means the process of modifying software after delivery to correct faults improve performance or  other attributes or adapt to a changed environment. (Reference ISO/IEC 14764:2006 as amended or superseded.) Software  maintenance does not include any customization or configuration.  \u201cSoftware product\u201d means any COTS which you propose to provide pursuant to the contract.  \u201cSource code\u201d means computer instructions and data definitions expressed in a form suitable for input into an assembler  compiler or other translator.  (b) Contract and Software Licensing Agreement are Separate. The State seeks to establish related but independent agreements  one with each applicable licensor of COTS and one with the contractor - regardless of whether the licensor and the contractor  are the same or different entities. As provided in the clause titled \u201cBid / Proposal As Offer To Contract\u201d a contract between  the State and the contractor results from an award made pursuant to this solicitation. In contrast the State\u2019s acceptance of  your offer does not serve as the State\u2019s acceptance of any software licensing agreement; rather software licensing agreements  Page 29    must be separately executed in order to be binding regardless of whether the license to use the software will be granted by  you or a third party. The contract as defined in the clause titled \u201cDefinitions\u201d will address all work (excluding the use rights  for any software product) and all terms regarding pricing payment and delivery of any software product. Accordingly the  State intends to pay contractor in order to acquire license rights for any software product but the license rights will be  governed by a software licensing agreement with the licensor.  (c) Critical Instructions. (1) Your offer must identify each software product you propose to provide identify the licensor and  explain which of the following licensing models apply: (i) you intend to license (or sublicense) the item directly to the State  or (ii) you intend to \u201cresell\u201d or distribute the item to the State (with licensing handled directly with the third-party licensor).  You should use the Software Table attached to this solicitation to assist you in providing this information. (2) Your offer must  NOT include any software licensing agreements; however for any software product identified in your offer you must submit  a software licensing agreement upon request of the procurement officer. You must be prepared to provide any requested  software licensing agreement within one business day of receiving a request. (3) Regardless of your licensing model your  price must include the cost of providing every software product you propose to provide to the State and those terms will form  part of the contract.  (d) Pre-Condition of Award. If the work you are offering to perform is dependent upon the licensing of a software product  by the State and the State is unsuccessful in negotiating an acceptable software licensing agreement for any software product  for which it finds such an agreement necessary your offer will be rejected. To facilitate the timely and successful negotiation  of a software licensing agreement deemed necessary by the State the State may ask you after opening but prior to award to  acquire from the licensor an executed copy of the piggyback. You should communicate with the licensors for any major or  critical software product well in advance of submitting a proposal and licensors should be informed that few changes will be  made to the piggyback. [The State already has and continues to enter into standing statewide licensing agreements for a  variety of computer programs. Without limiting any of the above requirements an applicable agreement may already exist  for one or more items of COTS you have identified.] [07-7B224-1]    SUBSTITUTIONS PROHIBITED - END PRODUCT PREFERENCES (SEP 2009)    If you receive the award as a result of the South Carolina end product or United States end product preference you may not  substitute a non-qualifying end product for a qualified end product. If you violate this provision the State may terminate  your contract for cause and you may be debarred. In addition you shall pay to the State an amount equal to twice the  difference between the price paid by the State and your evaluated price for the item for which you delivered a substitute.
