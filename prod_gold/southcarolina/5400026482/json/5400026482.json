(See Delivery clause) [07-7B220-1]      SOFTWARE LICENSING AGREEMENTS\u2013SINGLE SOLICITATION (FEB 2015)    (a) Definitions. As used in this clause these terms are defined as follows:  \u201cCommercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) Software\u201d means software used with no customization and for which source code is not  made available to licensees.  \u201cConfiguration\u201d means any customer-specific modification to software that does not require changes to the software\u2019s source  code such as rules-based rules engine based or parameter driven modifications to configure the software.  \u201cCustomization\u201d means any customer-specific modification to software that requires changes to the software\u2019s source code.  \u201cFirmware\u201d means software sold or licensed only in conjunction with machines designed for execution only on a machine  with which it is provided designed only for machines other than a dedicated computer and embedded into or installed on the  machine by the machine\u2019s manufacturer or seller.  \u201cLicensor\u201d means an entity that owns the intellectual property rights for an item of software or has the authority to license or  sublicense the software directly to the using governmental unit.  \u201cPiggyback\u201d means the document attached to this solicitation and entitled South Carolina Standard Amendment To End User  License Agreements For Commercial Off-The-Shelf Software \u2013 Single Agency  which serves as South Carolina\u2019s standard  amendment to a licensor\u2019s standard software licensing agreement (regardless of how denominated e.g. master software  licensing agreement end user license agreement) for COTS. [Note: While the piggyback is generally indicative of what the  State finds acceptable terms in a Licensor\u2019s standard software licensing agreement may need to be negotiated.]  \u201cSoftware\u201d means a combination of computer instructions and data definitions that enable computer hardware to perform  computational or control functions excluding firmware.  \u201cSoftware licensing agreement\u201d means any agreement regardless of how designated that defines the intellectual property  rights for or the rights to use any software product. A software licensing agreement must address only terms directly  associated with licensing the right to use the software and must not address any of the work governed by the contract or any  services (other than warranty services regarding the software code or associated documentation).  \u201cSoftware maintenance\u201d means the process of modifying software after delivery to correct faults improve performance or  other attributes or adapt to a changed environment. (Reference ISO/IEC 14764:2006 as amended or superseded.) Software  maintenance does not include any customization or configuration.  \u201cSoftware product\u201d means any COTS which you propose to provide pursuant to the contract.  \u201cSource code\u201d means computer instructions and data definitions expressed in a form suitable for input into an assembler  compiler or other translator.  (b) Contract and Software Licensing Agreement are Separate. The State seeks to establish related but independent agreements  one with each applicable licensor of COTS and one with the contractor - regardless of whether the licensor and the contractor  are the same or different entities. As provided in the clause titled \u201cBid / Proposal As Offer To Contract\u201d a contract between  the State and the contractor results from an award made pursuant to this solicitation. In contrast the State\u2019s acceptance of  your offer does not serve as the State\u2019s acceptance of any software licensing agreement; rather software licensing agreements  Page 29    must be separately executed in order to be binding regardless of whether the license to use the software will be granted by  you or a third party. The contract as defined in the clause titled \u201cDefinitions\u201d will address all work (excluding the use rights  for any software product) and all terms regarding pricing payment and delivery of any software product. Accordingly the  State intends to pay contractor in order to acquire license rights for any software product but the license rights will be  governed by a software licensing agreement with the licensor.  (c) Critical Instructions. (1) Your offer must identify each software product you propose to provide identify the licensor and  explain which of the following licensing models apply: (i) you intend to license (or sublicense) the item directly to the State  or (ii) you intend to \u201cresell\u201d or distribute the item to the State (with licensing handled directly with the third-party licensor).  You should use the Software Table attached to this solicitation to assist you in providing this information. (2) Your offer must  NOT include any software licensing agreements; however for any software product identified in your offer you must submit  a software licensing agreement upon request of the procurement officer. You must be prepared to provide any requested  software licensing agreement within one business day of receiving a request. (3) Regardless of your licensing model your  price must include the cost of providing every software product you propose to provide to the State and those terms will form  part of the contract.  (d) Pre-Condition of Award. If the work you are offering to perform is dependent upon the licensing of a software product  by the State and the State is unsuccessful in negotiating an acceptable software licensing agreement for any software product  for which it finds such an agreement necessary your offer will be rejected. To facilitate the timely and successful negotiation  of a software licensing agreement deemed necessary by the State the State may ask you after opening but prior to award to  acquire from the licensor an executed copy of the piggyback. You should communicate with the licensors for any major or  critical software product well in advance of submitting a proposal and licensors should be informed that few changes will be  made to the piggyback. [The State already has and continues to enter into standing statewide licensing agreements for a  variety of computer programs. Without limiting any of the above requirements an applicable agreement may already exist  for one or more items of COTS you have identified.] [07-7B224-1]    SUBSTITUTIONS PROHIBITED - END PRODUCT PREFERENCES (SEP 2009)    If you receive the award as a result of the South Carolina end product or United States end product preference you may not  substitute a non-qualifying end product for a qualified end product. If you violate this provision the State may terminate  your contract for cause and you may be debarred. In addition you shall pay to the State an amount equal to twice the  difference between the price paid by the State and your evaluated price for the item for which you delivered a substitute.

The contractor shall not be paid for any work performed or costs incurred that reasonably could have been avoided. As a  condition of payment contractor shall submit within three months of the effective date of the termination a claim specifying  the amounts due because of the termination. The absence of an appropriate termination for convenience clause in any  subcontract shall not increase the obligation of the state beyond what it would have been had the subcontract contained such  a clause.

The withholding requirement does  not apply to (1) payments on purchase orders for tangible personal property when the payments are not accompanied by  services to be performed in South Carolina (2) nonresidents who are not conducting business in South Carolina (3)  nonresidents for contracts that do not exceed $10000 in a calendar year or (4) payments to a nonresident who (a) registers  with either the S.C. Department of Revenue or the S.C. Secretary of State and (b) submits a Nonresident Taxpayer  Registration Affidavit - Income Tax Withholding Form I-312 to the person letting the contract.  The withholding requirement applies to every governmental entity that uses a contract (\"Using Entity\"). Nonresidents  should submit a separate copy of the Nonresident Taxpayer Registration Affidavit - Income Tax Withholding Form I-312  to every Using Entity that makes payment to the nonresident pursuant to this solicitation. Once submitted an affidavit is  valid for all contracts between the nonresident and the Using Entity unless the Using Entity receives notice from the  Department of Revenue that the exemption from withholding has been revoked.    Section 12-8-540 requires persons making payment to a nonresident taxpayer of rentals or royalties at a rate of $1200.00  or more a year for the use of or for the privilege of using property in South Carolina to withhold 7% of the total of each  payment made to a nonresident taxpayer who is not a corporation and 5% if the payment is made to a corporation.
